SWAPI_URL=https://swapi.py4e.com/api
```

### Start the Backend Server

For development:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

For production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:5501`. You can access the Swagger API documentation at `http://localhost:5501/swagger`.

## Frontend Setup
