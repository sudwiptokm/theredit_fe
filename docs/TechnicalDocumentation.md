# Star Wars Character Explorer - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Star Wars Character Explorer is a web application that allows users to browse and search for characters from the Star Wars universe. The application is built using Next.js for the frontend and NestJS for the backend.

## Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built with Next.js 15.3.2, using React 19 and TypeScript. It follows the App Router pattern introduced in Next.js 13+.

#### Key Technologies

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering, routing, and API handling
- **React**: For UI components
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Shadcn UI**: For UI components

#### Directory Structure

- `/src/app`: Contains the main application pages and layouts
- `/src/components`: Reusable React components
- `/src/lib`: Utility functions and API clients
- `/public`: Static assets

#### Key Components

1. **Layout Component** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - Provides the base HTML structure and global styles

2. **Character List** (`src/components/character-list.tsx`)
   - Displays a grid of character cards
   - Handles pagination and empty states

3. **Character Card** (`src/components/character-card.tsx`)
   - Displays basic information about a character
   - Links to the character detail page

4. **Character Details** (`src/components/character-details.tsx`)
   - Displays detailed information about a character
   - Organized into sections for personal information, physical attributes, films, etc.

5. **Search Bar** (`src/components/search-bar.tsx`)
   - Allows users to search for characters by name
   - Implements debounced search to prevent excessive API calls

6. **Pagination** (`src/components/pagination.tsx`)
   - Handles navigation between pages of results

#### API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API using the fetch API. The API client is defined in `src/lib/api.ts` and includes functions for:

- `getCharacters`: Fetches a list of characters with optional search and pagination
- `getCharacterDetails`: Fetches detailed information about a specific character

### Backend (NestJS)

The backend is built with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

#### Key Technologies

- **NestJS**: For the server framework
- **Axios**: For HTTP requests to the SWAPI
- **Cache Manager**: For caching API responses
- **Swagger**: For API documentation

#### Directory Structure

- `/src/characters`: Contains the characters module, controller, service, and DTOs
- `/src/app`: Contains the main application module and controller

#### Key Components

1. **Characters Controller** (`src/characters/characters.controller.ts`)
   - Defines the API endpoints for character operations
   - Handles request validation and response formatting

2. **Characters Service** (`src/characters/characters.service.ts`)
   - Implements the business logic for character operations
   - Communicates with the SWAPI to fetch character data
   - Enriches character data with related information (homeworld, species, films, etc.)
   - Implements caching to improve performance

#### API Endpoints

- `GET /characters`: Get a list of characters with optional search and pagination
- `GET /characters/search`: Search characters by name
- `GET /characters/:id`: Get detailed information about a specific character

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the frontend (search, pagination, character selection)
2. Frontend makes a request to the backend API
3. Backend checks cache for the requested data
4. If not in cache, backend makes requests to the SWAPI
5. Backend processes and enriches the data
6. Backend caches the response and returns it to the frontend
7. Frontend renders the data

## Performance Considerations

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Pages are rendered on the server for better SEO and initial load performance
- **Caching**: API responses are cached to reduce load on the SWAPI and improve response times
- **Debounced Search**: Search requests are debounced to prevent excessive API calls
- **Pagination**: Results are paginated to limit the amount of data transferred and rendered at once
- **Suspense and Loading States**: The application uses React Suspense for better loading experiences

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated on both the frontend and backend
- **CORS**: The backend is configured to only accept requests from the frontend domain
- **Error Handling**: Errors are properly caught and handled to prevent information leakage
